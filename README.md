# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
## [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard ].

In this project we signed up for the Kaggle competition. The aim was to complete the competition and submit the code for rank. Then improve the code for better analysis to improve the rank. The competition we entered was “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques”. The competition details can be found on site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. We implemented different advanced regression algorithms and compared the results for best prediction.

Following are the details for the project implementations: Dataset: Provided by Kaggle and in known as Ames Housing Dataset Data Mining Tool: Python scikit library. Analysis & Prediction: Prediction of the sale price of the houses Algorithms: The following algorithms were implemented in the project: Advanced Regression Techniques like LASSO, XgBoost, PCA etc.

The system requirement for Python SKLearn have no any minimal specification. Since data analysis is a computationally intensive task—the better your hardware, the better your experience. Also, the memory should be enough to handle big data sets.
